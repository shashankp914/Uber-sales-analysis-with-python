# Uber Data Analytics with Python

Welcome to the Uber Data Analytics project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that guides you through analyzing Uber ride data using Python. The goal is to explore and understand patterns in Uber usage across New York City.

## Project Overview

This project involves a step-by-step analysis of Uber ride data, covering everything from data loading and cleaning to detailed exploratory data analysis and visualization. By the end of this analysis, you'll gain insights into how Uber rides vary by time and location.

## Key Features

Here's what you'll find in the notebook:

- **Data Loading and Exploration:** Initial steps to load and understand the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values and converting data types.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Examining how Uber rides vary by time, including hour of the day and day of the week.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Exploring the spatial distribution of rides across New York City.
- **Visualization:** Using various plots and maps to illustrate findings.

## Libraries Used

The analysis leverages several powerful Python libraries:

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For creating informative visualizations.
- **Folium:** For interactive geographical mapping.

## Data Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

We start by loading the dataset using Pandas. This involves examining the first few rows to get a sense of the data structure and using descriptive statistics to summarize the data.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

In this phase, we address any missing values and convert columns like date and time into appropriate formats. We also create new features, such as the day of the week and hour of the day, to aid in our analysis.

### 3. Temporal Analysis

We delve into the temporal aspects of the data to understand:

- How ride frequency changes throughout the day.
- Patterns across different days of the week.
- Monthly trends in Uber rides.

### 4. Geographical Analysis

This part of the analysis focuses on where rides are happening:

- Visualizing pickup locations on interactive maps.
- Creating heatmaps to show ride density in various areas.
- Analyzing ride patterns in different boroughs of New York City.

### 5. Advanced Visualizations

To bring the data to life, we use:

- Stacked area charts to compare trends across boroughs.
- Heatmaps to visualize ride frequency by day and hour.
- Choropleth maps to show geographical ride density.

## How to Use

To explore this analysis yourself:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook and the necessary Python libraries installed.
3. Open the `Uber-data-analytics-with-python.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Execute the cells in order to follow along with the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project offers a deep dive into Uber ride patterns in New York City, showcasing the capabilities of Python for data analysis and visualization. The methods demonstrated here can be adapted for similar datasets, offering valuable insights for transportation analysis or other time-series and spatial data explorations. Enjoy your journey through the data!
